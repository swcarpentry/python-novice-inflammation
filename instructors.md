## Legend

We are using a dataset with records on inflammation from patients following an
arthritis treatment.

We make reference in the lesson that this data is somehow strange. It is strange
because it is fabricated! The script used to generate the inflammation data
is included as [`tools/gen_inflammation.py`](tools/gen_inflammation.py).

## Overall

This lesson is written as an introduction to Python,
but its real purpose is to introduce the single most important idea in programming:
how to solve problems by building functions,
each of which can fit in a programmer's working memory.
In order to teach that,
we must teach people a little about
the mechanics of manipulating data with lists and file I/O
so that their functions can do things they actually care about.
Our teaching order tries to show practical uses of every idea as soon as it is introduced;
instructors should resist the temptation to explain
the "other 90%" of the language
as well.

The final example asks them to build a command-line tool
that works with the Unix pipe-and-filter model.
We do this because it is a useful skill
and because it helps learners see that the software they use isn't magical.
Tools like `grep` might be more sophisticated than
the programs our learners can write at this point in their careers,
but it's crucial they realize this is a difference of scale rather than kind.

Explain that we use Python because:

*   It's free.
*   It has a lot of scientific libraries, and more are constantly being added.
*   It has a large scientific user community.
*   It's easier for novices to learn than most of the mature alternatives.
    (Software Carpentry originally used Perl;
    when we switched,
    we found that we could cover as much material in two days in Python
    as we'd covered in three days in Perl,
    and that retention was higher.)

We do *not* include instructions on running the IPython Notebook in the tutorial
because we want to focus on the language rather than the tools.
Instructors should, however, walk learners through some basic operations:
*   Launch from the command line with `ipython notebook`.
*   Create a new notebook.
*   Enter code or data in a cell and execute it.
*   Explain the difference between `In[#]` and `Out[#]`.

Watching the instructor grow programs step by step
is as helpful to learners as anything to do with Python.
Resist the urge to update a single cell repeatedly
(which is what you'd probably do in real life).
Instead,
clone the previous cell and write the update in the new copy
so that learners have a complete record of how the program grew.
Once you've done this,
you can say,
"Now why don't we just break things into small functions right from the start?"

The discussion of command-line scripts
assumes that students understand standard I/O and building filters,
which are covered in the lesson on the shell.

## Frequently Argued Issues (FAI)

*   `import ... as ...` syntax.

    This syntax is commonly used in the scientific Python community;
    it is explicitly recommended in documentation to `import numpy as np`
    and `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`. Despite that, we have decided
    not to introduce aliasing imports in this novice lesson due to the
    additional cognitive load it puts on students, despite the typing that
    it saves. A good summary of arguments for and against can be found in
    [PR #61](https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-inflammation/pull/61).

    It is up to you as an individual instructor whether you want to introduce
    these aliases when you teach this lesson, but we encourage you to please
    read those arguments thoroughly before deciding one way or the other.

## [Repeating Actions with Loops](02-loop.html)

Solutions to exercises:

> ## From 1 to N {.challenge}
> Using `range`,
> write a loop that uses `range` to print the first 3 natural numbers:
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> for i in range(1,4):
>    print i
> 1
> 2
> 3
> ~~~

> ## Computing powers with loops {.challenge}
> Write a loop that calculates the same result as `5 ** 3` using
> multiplication (and without exponentiation).
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> result = 1
> for i in range(0, 3):
>    result = result * 5
> print(result)
> ~~~
> ~~~ {.output}
> 125
> ~~~

> ## Reverse a string {.challenge}
>
> Write a loop that takes a string,
> and produces a new string with the characters in reverse order.
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> newstring = ''
> oldstring = 'Newton'
> length_old = len(oldstring)
> for char_index in range(length_old):
>    newstring = newstring + oldstring[length_old - char_index - 1]
> print(newstring)
> ~~~
> ~~~ {.output}
> 'notweN'
> ~~~

After discussing these challenges could be a good time to introduce the `b*=2` syntax.

## [Storing Multiple Values in Lists](03-lists.html)

Solutions to exercises:

> ## Turn a string into a list {.challenge}
>
> Use a for-loop to convert the string "hello" into a list of letters:
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> my_list = []
> for char in "hello":
>     my_list.append(char)
> print(my_list)
> ~~~
> ~~~ {.output}
> ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
> ~~~


## [Analyzing Data from Multiple Files](04-files.html)

## [Making Choices](05-cond.html)

Solutions to exercises:

> ## How many paths? {.challenge}
>
> Which of the following would be printed if you were to run this code? Why did you pick this answer?
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> if 4 > 5:
>     print('A')
> elif 4 == 5:
>     print('B')
> elif 4 < 5:
>     print('C')
> ~~~
>
> C gets printed, because the first two conditions, `4 > 5` and `4 == 5` are not true, but `4 < 5` is true.


> ## What is truth? {.challenge}
>
> After reading and running the code below,
> explain the rules for which values are considered true and which are considered false.
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> if '':
>     print('empty string is true')
> if 'word':
>     print('word is true')
> if []:
>     print('empty list is true')
> if [1, 2, 3]:
>     print('non-empty list is true')
> if 0:
>     print('zero is true')
> if 1:
>     print('one is true')
> ~~~
> ~~~ {.output}
> First line prints nothing: an empty string is false
> Second line prints 'word is true': a non-empty string is true
> Third line prints nothing: an empty list is false
> Fourth line prints 'non-empty list is true': a non-empty list is true
> Fifth line prints nothing: 0 is false
> Sixth line prints 'one is true': 1 is true
> ~~~

> ## Close enough {.challenge}
>
> Write some conditions that print `True` if the variable `a` is within 10% of the variable `b`
> and `False` otherwise.
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> a = 5
> b = 5.1
>
> if abs(a - b) < 0.1 * abs(b):
>     print('True')
> else:
>     print('False')
> ~~~
>
> Another possible solution:
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> print(abs(a - b) < 0.1 * abs(b))
> ~~~
> This works because the Boolean objects `True` and `False` have string representations which can be `print`ed.


> ## In-place operators {.challenge}
>
> Write some code that sums the positive and negative numbers in a list separately,
> using in-place operators.
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> positive_sum = 0
> negative_sum = 0
> test_list = [3,4,6,1,-1,-5,0,7,-8]
> for num in test_list:
>     if num > 0:
>         positive_sum += num
>     elif num == 0:
>         pass
>     else:
>         negative_sum += num
> print(positive_sum, negative_sum)
> ~~~
> ~~~ {.output}
> 21 -14
> ~~~
>
> Here `pass` means "don't do anything". In this particular case, it's not actually needed, since if `num==0` neither
> sum needs to change, but it illustrates the use of `elif`.

> ## Tuples and exchanges {.challenge}
>
> Explain what the overall effect of this code is:
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> left = 'L'
> right = 'R'
>
> temp = left
> left = right
> right = temp
> ~~~
> ~~~ {.output}
> The code swaps the contents of the variables right and left.
> ~~~
>
> Compare it to:
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> left, right = right, left
> ~~~
>
> Do they always do the same thing? Which do you find easier to read?
>
> ~~~ {.output}
> Yes, although it's possible the internal implementation is different. Answers will vary on which is easier to read.

> Write a function called `fence` that takes two parameters called `original` and `wrapper`
> and returns a new string that has the wrapper character at the beginning and end of the original.

> ~~~

> ## Rescaling an array {.challenge}
>
> Write a function `rescale` that takes an array as input
> and returns a corresponding array of values scaled to lie in the range 0.0 to 1.0.
> (Hint: If $L$ and $H$ are the lowest and highest values in the original array,
> then the replacement for a value $v$ should be $(v-L) / (H-L)$.)
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> def rescale(input_array):

> ~~~

> ## Testing and documenting your function {.challenge}
>
> Run the commands `help(numpy.arange)` and `help(numpy.linspace)`
> to see how to use these functions to generate regularly-spaced values,
> then use those values to test your `rescale` function.
> Once you've successfully tested your function,
> add a docstring that explains what it does.
>
> Examples:
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> rescale(np.arange(0,10.0))
> array([ 0.        ,  0.11111111,  0.22222222,  0.33333333,  0.44444444,
>        0.55555556,  0.66666667,  0.77777778,  0.88888889,  1.        ])
> rescale(np.linspace(0,100,5))
> array([ 0.  ,  0.25,  0.5 ,  0.75,  1.  ])
> '''sample docstring:
>    takes an array as input, and returns a corresponding array scaled so
>    that 0 corresponds to the minimum and 1 to the maximum value of the input array'''
> ~~~


> ## Defining defaults {.challenge}
>
> Rewrite the `rescale` function so that it scales data to lie between 0.0 and 1.0 by default,
> but will allow the caller to specify lower and upper bounds if they want.
> Compare your implementation to your neighbor's:
> do the two functions always behave the same way?
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> def rescale(input_array, low_val = 0.0, high_val = 1.0):
>     '''rescales input array values to lie between low_val and high_val'''
>     L = input_array.min()
>     H = input_array.max()
>     intermed_array = (input_array - L) / (H - L)
>     output_array = intermed_array * (high_val - low_val) + low_val
>     return output_array
> ~~~

> ## Variables inside and outside functions {.challenge}
>
> What does the following piece of code display when run - and why?
>
> ~~~ {.python}
> f = 0
> k = 0
>
> def f2k(f):
>   k = ((f-32)*(5.0/9.0)) + 273.15
>   return k
>
> print(f2k(8))
> print(f2k(41))
> print(f2k(32))
>
> print(k)
> ~~~
> ~~~ {.output}
> 259.81666666666666
> 287.15
> 273.15
> 0
> k is 0 because the `k` inside the function `f2k` doesn't know about the `k` defined outside the function.
