<ul>
<li>Import a library into a program using <code>import libraryname</code>.</li>
<li>Use the <code>numpy</code> library to work with arrays in Python.</li>
<li>Use <code>variable = value</code> to assign a value to a variable in order to record it in memory.</li>
<li>Variables are created on demand whenever a value is assigned to them.</li>
<li>Use <code>print(something)</code> to display the value of <code>something</code>.</li>
<li>The expression <code>array.shape</code> gives the shape of an array.</li>
<li>Use <code>array[x, y]</code> to select a single element from an array.</li>
<li>Array indices start at 0, not 1.</li>
<li>Use <code>low:high</code> to specify a slice that includes the indices from <code>low</code> to <code>high-1</code>.</li>
<li>All the indexing and slicing that works on arrays also works on strings.</li>
<li>Use <code># some kind of explanation</code> to add comments to programs.</li>
<li>Use <code>array.mean()</code>, <code>array.max()</code>, and <code>array.min()</code> to calculate simple statistics.</li>
<li>Use <code>array.mean(axis=0)</code> or <code>array.mean(axis=1)</code> to calculate statistics across the specified axis.</li>
<li>Use the <code>pyplot</code> library from <code>matplotlib</code> for creating simple visualizations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="repeating-actions-with-loops"><a href="02-loop.html">Repeating Actions with Loops</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>for variable in collection</code> to process the elements of a collection one at a time.</li>
<li>The body of a for loop must be indented.</li>
<li>Use <code>len(thing)</code> to determine the length of something that contains other values.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="storing-multiple-values-in-lists"><a href="03-lists.html">Storing Multiple Values in Lists</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>[value1, value2, value3, ...]</code> creates a list.</li>
<li>Lists are indexed and sliced in the same way as strings and arrays.</li>
<li>Lists are mutable (i.e., their values can be changed in place).</li>
<li>Strings are immutable (i.e., the characters in them cannot be changed).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="analyzing-data-from-multiple-files"><a href="04-files.html">Analyzing Data from Multiple Files</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>glob.glob(pattern)</code> to create a list of files whose names match a pattern.</li>
<li>Use <code>*</code> in a pattern to match zero or more characters, and <code>?</code> to match any single character.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="making-choices"><a href="05-cond.html">Making Choices</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>ImageGrid</code> class from the <code>ipythonblocks</code> library to create simple “images” made of colored blocks.</li>
<li>Specify colors use (red, green, blue) triples, each component of which is an integer in the range 0..255.</li>
<li>Use <code>if condition</code> to start a conditional statement, <code>elif condition</code> to provide additional tests, and <code>else</code> to provide a default.</li>
<li>The bodies of the branches of conditional statements must be indented.</li>
<li>Use <code>==</code> to test for equality.</li>
<li><code>X and Y</code> is only true if both X and Y are true.</li>
<li><code>X or Y</code> is true if either X or Y, or both, are true.</li>
<li>Zero, the empty string, and the empty list are considered false; all other numbers, strings, and lists are considered true.</li>
<li>Nest loops to operate on multi-dimensional data.</li>
<li>Put code whose parameters change frequently in a function, then call it with different parameter values to customize its behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-functions"><a href="06-func.html">Creating Functions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Define a function using <code>def name(...params...)</code>.</li>
<li>The body of a function must be indented.</li>
<li>Call a function using <code>name(...values...)</code>.</li>
<li>Numbers are stored as integers or floating-point numbers.</li>
<li>Integer division produces the whole part of the answer (not the fractional part).</li>
<li>Each time a function is called, a new stack frame is created on the <strong>call stack</strong> to hold its parameters and local variables.</li>
<li>Python looks for variables in the current stack frame before looking for them at the top level.</li>
<li>Use <code>help(thing)</code> to view help for something.</li>
<li>Put docstrings in functions to provide help for that function.</li>
<li>Specify default values for parameters when defining a function using <code>name=value</code> in the parameter list.</li>
<li>Parameters can be passed by matching based on name, by position, or by omitting them (in which case the default value is used).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="errors-and-exceptions"><a href="07-errors.html">Errors and Exceptions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Tracebacks can look intimidating, but they give us a lot of useful information about what went wrong in our program, including where the error occurred and what type of error it was.</li>
<li>An error having to do with the “grammar” or syntax of the program is called a <code>SyntaxError</code>. If the issue has to do with how the code is indented, then it will be called an <code>IndentationError</code>.</li>
<li>A <code>NameError</code> will occur if you use a variable that has not been defined (either because you meant to use quotes around a string, you forgot to define the variable, or you just made a typo).</li>
<li>Containers like lists and dictionaries will generate errors if you try to access items in them that do not exist. For lists, this type of error is called an <code>IndexError</code>; for dictionaries, it is called a <code>KeyError</code>.</li>
<li>Trying to read a file that does not exist will give you an <code>IOError</code>. Trying to read a file that is open for writing, or writing to a file that is open for reading, will also give you an <code>IOError</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="defensive-programming"><a href="08-defensive.html">Defensive Programming</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Program defensively, i.e., assume that errors are going to arise, and write code to detect them when they do.</li>
<li>Put assertions in programs to check their state as they run, and to help readers understand how those programs are supposed to work.</li>
<li>Use preconditions to check that the inputs to a function are safe to use.</li>
<li>Use postconditions to check that the output from a function is safe to use.</li>
<li>Write tests before writing code in order to help determine exactly what that code is supposed to do.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="debugging"><a href="09-debugging.html">Debugging</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Know what code is supposed to do <em>before</em> trying to debug it.</li>
<li>Make it fail every time.</li>
<li>Make it fail fast.</li>
<li>Change one thing at a time, and for a reason.</li>
<li>Keep track of what you’ve done.</li>
<li>Be humble.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="command-line-programs"><a href="10-cmdline.html">Command-Line Programs</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>sys</code> library connects a Python program to the system it is running on.</li>
<li>The list <code>sys.argv</code> contains the command-line arguments that a program was run with.</li>
<li>Avoid silent failures.</li>
<li>The “file” <code>sys.stdin</code> connects to a program’s standard input.</li>
<li>The “file” <code>sys.stdout</code> connects to a program’s standard output.</li>
</ul>
