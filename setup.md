## Overview

This lesson is designed to be run on a personal computer.
All of the software and data used in this lesson are freely available online,
and instructions on how to obtain them are provided below.

## Install Python

In this lesson, we will be using Python 3 with some of its most popular scientific libraries.
One can install a plain-vanilla Python and all required libraries by hand. If you've followed
the [Carpentry workshop installation instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#python-1)
you will have installed miniforge and the required libraries in an environment called `carpentries`. 
Before starting you'll want to type `conda activate carpentries` in order to activate that environment.

## Obtain lesson materials

1. Download [python-novice-inflammation-data.zip][zipfile1]
  and [python-novice-inflammation-code.zip][zipfile2].
2. Create a folder called `swc-python` on your Desktop.
3. Move downloaded files to `swc-python`.
4. Unzip the files.

You should see two folders called `data` and `code` in the `swc-python` directory on your
Desktop.

## Launch Python interface

To start working with Python, we need to launch a program that will interpret and execute our
Python commands. Below we list several options. If you don't have a preference, proceed with the
top option in the list that is available on your machine. Otherwise, you may use any interface
you like.

## Option A: Jupyter Notebook

A Jupyter Notebook provides a browser-based interface for working with Python.
You can launch a notebook from the command line:

:::::::::::::::: spoiler

## Command line (Terminal)

1\. Navigate to the `data` directory:

::::::::::::::::: spoiler

## Unix shell

If you're using a Unix shell application, such as Terminal app in macOS, Console or Terminal
in Linux, or [Git Bash][gitbash] on Windows, execute the following command:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/swc-python/data
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::: spoiler

## Command Prompt (Windows)

On Windows, you can use its native Command Prompt program.  The easiest way to start it up is
pressing <kbd>Windows Logo Key</kbd>\+<kbd>R</kbd>, entering `cmd`, and hitting
<kbd>Return</kbd>. In the Command Prompt, use the following command to navigate to
the `data` folder:

```source
cd /D %userprofile%\Desktop\swc-python\data
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

2\. Start Jupyter server

::::::::::::::::: spoiler

## Unix shell

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::: spoiler

## Command Prompt (Windows)

```source
python -m notebook
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

3\. Launch the notebook by clicking on the "New" button on the right and selecting "Python 3"
from the drop-down menu:

## Option B: IPython interpreter

IPython is an alternative solution situated somewhere in between the plain-vanilla Python
interpreter and Jupyter Notebook. It provides an interactive command-line based interpreter with
various convenience features and commands.  You can install IPython on your system
[system](https://ipython.org/install.html).

To start using IPython, execute:

```source
ipython
```

## Option C: plain-vanilla Python interpreter

To launch a plain-vanilla Python interpreter, execute:

```source
python
```

If you are using [Git Bash on Windows][gitbash], you have to call Python *via* `winpty`:

```source
winpty python
```
