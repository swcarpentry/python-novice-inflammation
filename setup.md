You need to download some files to follow this lesson:

1. Make a new folder in your Desktop called `python-novice-inflammation`.
2. Download [python-novice-inflammation-data.zip](./python-novice-inflammation-data.zip) and move the file to this folder.
3. If it's not unzipped yet, double-click on it to unzip it. You should end up with a new folder called `data`.
4. You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:

~~~
$ cd
$ cd Desktop/python-novice-inflammation/data
~~~
{: .source}

If you will be using the Jupyter (IPython) notebook for the lesson,
you should have already
[installed Anaconda](http://swcarpentry.github.io/workshop-template/#setup)
which includes the notebook.

To start the notebook, open a terminal or git bash and type the command:

~~~
$ jupyter notebook
~~~
{: .source}

To start the Python interpreter without the notebook, open a terminal or git bash and type the command:

~~~
$ python
~~~
{: .source}
