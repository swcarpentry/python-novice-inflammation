An introduction to Python for non-programmers using inflammation data.

## About the Lesson

This lesson teaches novice programmers to write modular code to perform data analysis
using Python. The emphasis, however, is on teaching language-agnostic principles of
programming such as automation with loops and encapsulation with functions,
see [Best Practices for Scientific Computing][best-practices] and
[Good enough practices in scientific computing][good-enough-practices] to learn more.

The example used in this lesson analyses a set of 12 files with simulated inflammation
data collected from a trial for a new treatment for arthritis. Learners are shown
how it is better to automate analysis using functions instead of repeating analysis
steps manually.

This lesson is also available in [R][R] and [MATLAB][MATLAB].
