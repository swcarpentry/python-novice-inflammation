An introduction to Python for non-programmers using inflammation data.

## About the Lesson

This lesson teaches novice programmers to write modular code to perform data analysis
using Python. The emphasis, however, is on teaching language-agnostic principles of
programming such as automation with loops and encapsulation with functions,
see [Best Practices for Scientific Computing][best-practices] and
[Good enough practices in scientific computing][good-practices] to learn more.

The example used in this lesson analyses a set of 12 files with simulated inflammation
data collected from a trial for a new treatment for arthritis. Learners are shown
how it is better to automate analysis using functions instead of repeating analysis
steps manually.

The rendered version of the lesson is available at:
<https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/>.

This lesson is also available in [R][R] and [MATLAB][MATLAB].
