    "variables and lists,\n",
    "file I/O,\n",
    "loops,\n",
    "conditionals,\n",
    "and functions.\n",
    "What they *haven't* done is show us how to tell\n",
    "whether a program is getting the right answer,\n",
    "and how to tell if it's *still* getting the right answer\n",
    "as we make changes to it.\n",

    "To achieve that,\n",
    "we need to:\n",

    "*   Write programs that check their own operation.\n",

    "If it's true,\n",
    "Python does nothing,\n",

    "Python halts the program immediately\n",

    "this piece of code halts as soon as the loop encounters a value that isn't positive:"
