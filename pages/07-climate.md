## Working With Climate Data


<div class="">
<p>To pull everything together, we'll analyze some climate data to find out whether some parts of the world are getting drier faster than others.</p>
</div>


<div class="objectives">
<h4 id="objectives">Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>Write Python programs to download data sets using simple REST APIs.</li>
<li>Explain what CSV is, and read CSV data sets.</li>
<li>Write simple tests for functions.</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Step 1: Finding the Data


<div class="">
<p>A growing number of organizations make data sets available on the web in a style called <a href="../../gloss.html#rest">REST</a>, which stands for REpresentational State Transfer. The details (and ideology) aren't important; what matters is that when REST is used, every data set is identified by a URL.</p>
<p>For this example, we'll use data generated by 15 global circulation models that is provided through the World Bank's <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/developers/climate-data-api">Climate Data API</a>. According to the API's home page, the data sets containing yearly averages for various values are identified by URLs of the form:</p>
<pre>
http://climatedataapi.worldbank.org/climateweb/rest/v1/country/cru/<em><strong>var</strong></em>/year/<em><strong>iso3</strong></em>.<em><strong>ext</strong></em>
</pre>

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>var</strong></em> is either <code>pr</code> (for precipitation) or <code>tas</code> (for &quot;temperature at surface&quot;);</li>
<li><em><strong>iso3</strong></em> is the International Standards Organization (ISO) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3">3-letter code for a specific country</a>, such as &quot;CAN&quot; for Canada or &quot;BRA&quot; for Brazil; and</li>
<li><em><strong>ext</strong></em> (short for &quot;extension&quot;) specifies the format we want the data in. There are several choices for format, but the simplest is <a href="../../gloss.html#csv">comma-separated values</a> (CSV), in which each record is a row, and the values in each row are separated by commas. (CSV is frequently used for spreadsheet data.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if we want the average annual temperature in Canada as a CSV file, the URL is:</p>
<pre>
http://climatedataapi.worldbank.org/climateweb/rest/v1/country/cru/tas/year/CAN.csv
</pre>

<p>If we paste that URL into a browser, it displays:</p>
<pre><code>year,data
1901,-7.67241907119751
1902,-7.862711429595947
1903,-7.910782814025879
...
2007,-6.819293975830078
2008,-7.2008957862854
2009,-6.997011661529541</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<h4>Behind the Scenes</h4>
<p>This particular data set might be stored in a file on the server, or the server might do this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Receive our URL.</li>
<li>Break it into pieces.</li>
<li>Extract the three key fields (the variable, the country code, and the desired format).</li>
<li>Fetch the desired data from a database.</li>
<li>Format the data as CSV.</li>
<li>Send that to our browser.</li>
</ol>
<p>As long as the World Bank doesn't change its URLs, it can switch back and forth without breaking our programs.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>


<div class="challenges">
<h4 id="challenges">Challenges</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Read the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/developers/climate-data-api">documentation</a> for the Climate Data API, and then write URLs to find the annual average temperature for Afghanistan between 1980 and 1999.</li>
</ol>
</div>

### Step 2: Getting the Data


<div>
<p>If we only wanted to look at data for two or three countries, we could just download those files one by one. But we want to compare data for many different pairs of countries, which means we should write a program.</p>
<p>Python has a library called <code>urllib2</code> for working with URLs. It is clumsy to use, though, so many people (including us) prefer a third-party library called <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">Requests</a>. To install it, run the command:</p>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>!pip install requests</pre>
</div>

<div class="out">
<pre>Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): requests in /Users/gwilson/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages
Cleaning up...
</pre>
</div>


<div>
<p>(We get this message because we already have it installed; if you don't, you'll see a different message.) We can now get the data we want like this:</p>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>import requests
url = &#39;http://climatedataapi.worldbank.org/climateweb/rest/v1/country/cru/tas/year/CAN.csv&#39;
response = requests.get(url)
if response.status_code != 200:
    print &#39;Failed to get data:&#39;, response.status_code
else:
    print &#39;First 100 characters of data is&#39;
    print response.text[:100]</pre>
</div>

<div class="out">
<pre>First 100 characters of data is
year,data
1901,-7.67241907119751
1902,-7.862711429595947
1903,-7.910782814025879
1904,-8.15572929382
</pre>
</div>


<div>
<p>The first line imports the <code>requests</code> library. The second defines the URL for the data we want; we could just pass this URL as an argument to the <code>requests.get</code> call on the third line, but assigning it to a variable makes it easier to find.</p>
<p><code>requests.get</code> actually gets our data. More specifically, it:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>creates a connection to the <code>climatedataapi.worldbank.org</code> server;</li>
<li>sends it the URL <code>/climateweb/rest/v1/country/cru/tas/year/CAN.csv</code>;</li>
<li>creates an object in memory on our computer to hold the response;</li>
<li>assigns a number to the object's <code>status_code</code> member variable to tell us whether the request succeeded or not; and</li>
<li>assigns the data sent back by the web server to the object's <code>text</code> member variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The server can return many different <a href="../../gloss.html#http-status-code">status codes</a>; the most common are:</p>
<table>
  <tr><td>
200
</td><td>
OK
</td><td>
The request has succeeded.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td>
204
</td><td>
No Content
</td><td>
The server has completed the request, but doesn't need to return any data.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td>
400
</td><td>
Bad Request
</td><td>
The request is badly formatted.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td>
401
</td><td>
Unauthorized
</td><td>
The request requires authentication.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td>
404
</td><td>
Not Found
</td><td>
The requested resource could not be found.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td>
408
</td><td>
Timeout
</td><td>
The server gave up waiting for the client.
</td></tr>
  <tr><td>
418
</td><td>
I'm a teapot
</td><td>
No, really...
</td></tr>
  <tr><td>
500
</td><td>
Internal Server Error
</td><td>
An error occurred in the server.
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Of these, 200 is the only one we really care about: if we get anything else, the response probably doesn't contain actual data (though it might contain an error message).</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Some People Don't Follow the Rules</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, some sites don't return a meaningful status code. Instead, they return 200 for <em>everything</em>, then put an error message (if appropriate) in the text of the response. This works when the result is being displayed to a human being, but fails miserably when the &quot;reader&quot; is a program that can't actually read.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>


<div class="challenges">
<h4 id="challenges">Challenges</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Modify the URL in the program above so that it asks for data from a non-existent country and see what the status code is.</li>
</ol>
</div>

### Step 3: Parsing the Data


<div>
<p>Our little program gets the data we want, but returns it as one long character string rather than as a list of numbers. There are two ways we could convert the former to the latter:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write a function to split that string on newline characters to create lines, then split the lines on commas and convert the second part of each to a number.</li>
<li>Use a couple of Python libraries to do this for us.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most experienced programmers would say that the second approach is easier, but &quot;easy&quot; is relative: using standard libraries is only more effective in practice if we know those libraries exist, and know enough about them to think about our problem in terms of what they can do.</p>
<p>Let's give both methods a try. Here's a small program to test the first approach:</p>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>input_data = &#39;&#39;&#39;1901,12.3
1902,45.6
1903,78.9&#39;&#39;&#39;

as_lines = input_data.split(&#39;\n&#39;)
print &#39;input data as lines:&#39;
print as_lines

for line in as_lines:
    fields = line.split(&#39;,&#39;) # turn &#39;1901,12.3&#39; into [&#39;1901&#39;, &#39;12.3&#39;]
    year = int(fields[0])    # turn the text &#39;1901&#39; into the integer 1901
    value = float(fields[1]) # turn the text &#39;12.3&#39; into the number 12.3
    print year, &#39;:&#39;, value</pre>
</div>

<div class="out">
<pre>input data as lines:
[&#39;1901,12.3&#39;, &#39;1902,45.6&#39;, &#39;1903,78.9&#39;]
1901 : 12.3
1902 : 45.6
1903 : 78.9
</pre>
</div>


<div>
<p>We start by defining a string in our program to use as input data so that we can easily check the correctness of our output. The first three lines of code turn this one multi-line string into a list of strings by splitting on the newline characters (which are written <code>\n</code> in our program). The <code>for</code> loop then extracts the year and value from each line by splitting the line on the comma and converting the digits to numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Escape Sequences</h4>
<p>Programmers need a way to put quotes, double quotes, and other special characters in strings. To do this, they use <a href="../../gloss.html#escape-sequence">escape sequences</a>: <code>\'</code> for a single quote, <code>\&quot;</code> for a double quote, <code>\n</code> for a newline, and so on. This means that: <sub>~</sub> 'This can't bewithout&quot;escape sequences&quot;.' <sub>~</sub> prints as: <sub>~</sub> This can't be written without &quot;escape sequences&quot;. <sub>~</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now let's have a look at how we could do this using a couple of standard Python libraries. The first, called <code>cStringIO</code>, lets Python treat a string as if it was an input file:</p>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>import cStringIO

data = &#39;&#39;&#39;first
second
third&#39;&#39;&#39;

reader = cStringIO.StringIO(data)
for line in reader:
    print line</pre>
</div>

<div class="out">
<pre>first

second

third
</pre>
</div>


<div>
<p>The <code>cStringIO.StringIO</code> object that we assign to <code>reader</code> is an object that behaves like a file, but reads characters from a string instead of from something on our hard drive. As we'll see in the exercises, we can also write to a <code>StringIO</code> object, which is very useful when we're testing programs.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Why the 'c'?</h3>
<p>The 'c' at the start of <code>cStringIO</code>'s name comes from the fact that it is a rewrite in C of an older and slower library called <code>StringIO</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second library we'll use is called <code>csv</code>. It doesn't read data itself: instead, it takes the lines read by something else and turns them into lists of values by splitting on commas:</p>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>import csv

data = &#39;&#39;&#39;first,FIRST
second,SECOND
third,THIRD&#39;&#39;&#39;
reader = cStringIO.StringIO(data)
wrapper = csv.reader(reader)
for record in wrapper:
    print record</pre>
</div>

<div class="out">
<pre>[&#39;first&#39;, &#39;FIRST&#39;]
[&#39;second&#39;, &#39;SECOND&#39;]
[&#39;third&#39;, &#39;THIRD&#39;]
</pre>
</div>


<div>
<p>Putting it all together, we can get data for Canada like this:</p>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>url = &#39;http://climatedataapi.worldbank.org/climateweb/rest/v1/country/cru/tas/year/CAN.csv&#39;
response = requests.get(url)
if response.status_code != 200:
    print &#39;Failed to get data:&#39;, response.status_code
else:
    reader = cStringIO.StringIO(response.text)
    wrapper = csv.reader(reader)
    for record in wrapper:
        year = int(record[0])
        value = float(record[1])
        print year, &#39;:&#39;, value</pre>
</div>

<div class="out">
<pre>---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-6-da21db395042&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
      7     wrapper = csv.reader(reader)
      8     for record in wrapper:
----&gt; 9         year = int(record[0])
     10         value = float(record[1])
     11         print year, &#39;:&#39;, value

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: &#39;year&#39;</pre>
</div>


<div>
<p>That error occurs because the first line of data is:</p>
<pre><code>year,data</code></pre>
<p>When we try to convert the string <code>'year'</code> to an integer, Python quite rightly complains. The fix is straightforward: we just need to ignore lines that start with the word <code>year</code>. And while we're at it, we'll put our results into a list instead of just printing them:</p>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>url = &#39;http://climatedataapi.worldbank.org/climateweb/rest/v1/country/cru/tas/year/CAN.csv&#39;
response = requests.get(url)
if response.status_code != 200:
    print &#39;Failed to get data:&#39;, response.status_code
else:
    reader = cStringIO.StringIO(response.text)
    wrapper = csv.reader(reader)
    results = []
    for record in wrapper:
        if record[0] != &#39;year&#39;:
            year = int(record[0])
            value = float(record[1])
            results.append([year, value])
    print &#39;first five results&#39;
    print results[:5]</pre>
</div>

<div class="out">
<pre>first five results

</div>

</ol>
</div>

### Step 4: Making a Reusable Function


<div>
<p>Now that we know how to get the data for Canada, let's create a function that will do the same thing for an arbitrary country. The steps are simple: copy the code we've written into a function that takes a 3-letter country code as a parameter, and insert that country code into the URL at the appropriate place:</p>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>def get_annual_mean_temp_by_country(country):
    &#39;&#39;&#39;Get the annual mean temperature for a country given its 3-letter ISO code (such as &#34;CAN&#34;).&#39;&#39;&#39;
    url = &#39;http://climatedataapi.worldbank.org/climateweb/rest/v1/country/cru/tas/year/&#39; + country + &#39;.csv&#39;
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print &#39;Failed to get data:&#39;, response.status_code
    else:
        reader = cStringIO.StringIO(response.text)
        wrapper = csv.reader(reader)
        results = []
        for record in wrapper:
            if record[0] != &#39;year&#39;:
                year = int(record[0])
                value = float(record[1])
                results.append([year, value])
        return results</pre>
</div>


<div>
<p>This works:</p>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>canada = get_annual_mean_temp_by_country(&#39;CAN&#39;)
print &#39;first five entries for Canada:&#39;, canada[:5]</pre>
</div>

<div class="out">
<pre>first five entries for Canada: [[1901, -7.67241907119751], [1902, -7.862711429595947], [1903, -7.910782814025879], [1904, -8.155729293823242], [1905, -7.547311305999756]]
</pre>
</div>


<div>
<p>but there's a problem. Look what happens when we pass in an invalid country identifier:</p>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>latveria = get_annual_mean_temp_by_country(&#39;LTV&#39;)
print &#39;first five entries for Latveria:&#39;, latveria[:5]</pre>
</div>

<div class="out">
<pre>first five entries for Latveria: []
</pre>
</div>


<div>
<p>Latveria doesn't exist, so why is our function returning an empty list rather than printing an error message? The non-appearance of an error message must mean that the response code was 200; if so, we would have gone into the <code>else</code> branch, assigned an empty list to <code>results</code>, and then... hm... All right, if the response code was 200 and there was no data, that would explain what we're seeing.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Editing vs. Copying</h4>
<p>If we were writing this function in order to use it for real data analysis, we would go back and change it in place. Since we want to show both the flawed version and its replacement, we've copied it instead.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>def get_annual_mean_temp_by_country(country):
    &#39;&#39;&#39;Get the annual mean temperature for a country given its 3-letter ISO code (such as &#34;CAN&#34;).&#39;&#39;&#39;
    url = &#39;http://climatedataapi.worldbank.org/climateweb/rest/v1/country/cru/tas/year/&#39; + country + &#39;.csv&#39;
    print &#39;url used is&#39;, url
    response = requests.get(url)
    print &#39;response code:&#39;, response.status_code
    print &#39;length of data:&#39;, len(response.text)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print &#39;Failed to get data:&#39;, response.status_code
    else:
        reader = cStringIO.StringIO(response.text)
        wrapper = csv.reader(reader)
        results = []
        for record in wrapper:
            if record[0] != &#39;year&#39;:
                year = int(record[0])
                value = float(record[1])
                results.append([year, value])
        return results

latveria = get_annual_mean_temp_by_country(&#39;LTV&#39;)
print &#39;number of records for Latveria:&#39;, len(latveria)</pre>
</div>

<div class="out">

<div>
<p>Great: after a bit more experimenting, we discover that the site <em>always</em> returns a 200 status code. The only way to tell if there's real data or not will be to check if <code>response.text</code> is empty. Here's the updated function:</p>

    results = []
    if len(response.text) &gt; 0:
        reader = cStringIO.StringIO(response.text)
        wrapper = csv.reader(reader)
        for record in wrapper:
            if record[0] != &#39;year&#39;:

                results.append([year, value])

### Step 5: Comparing Countries


<div>
<p>Now that we can get surface temperatures for different countries, we can write a function to compare those values. (We'll jump straight into writing a function because by now it's clear that's what we're eventually going to do anyway.) Here's our first cut:</p>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>def diff_records(left, right):
    &#39;&#39;&#39;Given lists of [year, value] pairs, return list of [year, difference] pairs.&#39;&#39;&#39;
    num_years = len(left)
    results = []
    for i in range(num_years):
        left_year, left_value = left[i]
        right_year, right_value = right[i]
        difference = left_value - right_value
        results.append([left_year, difference])
    return results</pre>
</div>


<div>
<p>Here, we're using the number of entries in <code>left</code> (which we find with <code>len(left)</code>) to control our loop. The expression:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(num_years):</code></pre>
<p>runs <code>i</code> from 0 to <code>num_years-1</code>, which corresponds exactly to the legal indices of <code>left</code>. Inside the loop we unpack the left and right years and values from the list entries, then append a pair containing a year and a difference to <code>results</code>, which we return at the end.</p>
<p>To see if this function works, we can run a couple of tests on made-up data:</p>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>print &#39;one record:&#39;, diff_records([[1900, 1.0]],
                                  [[1900, 2.0]])
print &#39;two records:&#39;, diff_records([[1900, 1.0], [1901, 10.0]],
                                   [[1900, 2.0], [1901, 20.0]])</pre>
</div>

<div class="out">
<pre>one record: [[1900, -1.0]]
two records: [[1900, -1.0], [1901, -10.0]]

<p>The first test gives us an answer even though the years didn't match: we get a result, but it's meaningless. The second case gives us a partial result, again without telling us there's a problem, while the third crashes because we're using <code>left</code> to determine the number of records, but <code>right</code> doesn't have that many.</p>
<p>The first two problems are actually worse than the third because they are <a href="../../gloss.html#silent-failure">silent failures</a>: the function does the wrong thing, but doesn't indicate that in any way. Let's fix that:</p>

<div>
<p>Excellent: the assertions we've added will now alert us if we try to work with badly-formatted or inconsistent data.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>There's a Better Way to Do It</h4>
<p>We had to run each test in a cell of its own because Python stops executed the code in a cell as soon as an assertion fails, and we want to make sure all three tests actually run. A <a href="../../gloss.html#unit-testing">unit testing</a> library would handle this for us, and do much else as well; we cover unit testing libraries in our intermediate lesson on Python.</p>

<li><p>Should <code>get_annual_mean_temp_by_country</code> use an assertion to fail if it doesn't get data? Why or why not?</p></li>
<li><p>Python includes a function called <code>enumerate</code> that's often used in <code>for</code> loops. This loop: <sub>~</sub> for (i, c) in enumerate('abc'): print i, '=', c <sub>~</sub> prints: <sub>~</sub> 0 = a 1 = b 2 = c <sub>~</sub> Rewrite <code>diff_records</code> to use <code>enumerate</code>.</p></li>

</div>

### Step 6: Putting It All Together


<div>
<p>We now have all the tools we need to visualize the temperature differences between countries:</p>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>%matplotlib inline

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

australia = get_annual_mean_temp_by_country(&#39;AUS&#39;)
canada = get_annual_mean_temp_by_country(&#39;CAN&#39;)
diff = diff_records(australia, canada)
plt.plot(diff)
plt.show()</pre>
</div>

<div class="out">
<pre>
</pre>
</div>


<div>
<p>That's not what we want: the library has interpreted our list of pairs as two corresponding curves rather than as the (x,y) coordinates for one curve. Let's convert our list of (year, difference) pairs into a NumPy array:</p>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>import numpy as np
d = np.array(diff)</pre>
</div>


<div>
<p>and then plot the first column against the second:</p>
</div>


<div class="in">
<pre>plt.plot(d[:, 0], d[:, 1])
plt.show()</pre>
</div>

<div class="out">
<pre></pre>
</div>


<div>
<p>It looks like the difference is slowly decreasing, but the signal is very noisy. At this point, if we wanted a real answer, it would be time to break out a curve-fitting library.</p>
</div>


<div class="challenges">
<h4 id="challenges">Challenges</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Modify the plotting commands so that the Y-axis scale runs from 0 to 32. Do you think this gives you a more accurate or less accurate view of this data?</li>
</ol>
</div>
