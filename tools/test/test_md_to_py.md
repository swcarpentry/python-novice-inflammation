# Markdown to Python test

This file is a test for converting Markdown to Python.

This text should be commented out.

The text below should be turned into code:
~~~ {.python}
print("hello world")
~~~

This text below should not be code since it isn't Python
~~~
echo "hello world"
~~~

Here's some more Python
~~~ {.python}

print("hello world part 2")

print("hello world part 3")

~~~
