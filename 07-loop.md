We have created a function called `analyze`
that creates graphs of the minimum, average, and maximum daily inflammation rates
for a single data set:

~~~ {.python}
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def analyze(filename):
    data = np.loadtxt(fname=filename, delimiter=',')
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))
    
    plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
    plt.ylabel('average')
    plt.plot(data.mean(0))
    
    plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
    plt.ylabel('max')
    plt.plot(data.max(0))
    
    plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
    plt.ylabel('min')
    plt.plot(data.min(0))
    
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

analyze('inflammation-01.csv')
~~~

![Analysis of inflammation-01.csv](fig/03-loop_2_0.png)\ 

We can use it to analyze other data sets one by one:

~~~ {.python}
analyze('inflammation-02.csv')
~~~

![Analysis of inflammation-02.csv](fig/03-loop_4_0.png)\ 

but we have a dozen data sets right now and more on the way.
We want to create plots for all our data sets with a single statement.
To do that,
we'll have to teach the computer how to repeat things.

## For Loops

Suppose we want to print each character in the word "lead" on a line of its own.
One way is to use four `print` statements:

~~~ {.python}
def print_characters(element):
    print element[0]
    print element[1]
    print element[2]
    print element[3]

print_characters('lead')
~~~
~~~ {.output}
l
e
a
d
~~~

but that's a bad approach for two reasons:

1.  It doesn't scale:
    if we want to print the characters in a string that's hundreds of letters long,
    we'd be better off just typing them in.

1.  It's fragile:
    if we give it a longer string,
    it only prints part of the data,
    and if we give it a shorter one,
    it produces an error because we're asking for characters that don't exist.

~~~ {.python}
print_characters('tin')
~~~
~~~ {.error}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-13-5bc7311e0bf3> in <module>()
----> 1 print_characters('tin')

<ipython-input-12-11460561ea56> in print_characters(element)
      3     print element[1]
      4     print element[2]
----> 5     print element[3]
      6 
      7 print_characters('lead')

IndexError: string index out of range
~~~ {.output}
t
i
n
~~~

Here's a better approach:

~~~ {.python}
def print_characters(element):
    for char in element:
        print char

print_characters('lead')
~~~

This is shorter---certainly shorter than something that prints every character in a hundred-letter string---and
more robust as well:

~~~ {.python}
print_characters('oxygen')
~~~

The improved version of `print_characters` uses a **for loop**
to repeat an operation---in this case, printing---once for each thing in a collection.
The general form of a loop is:

~~~ {.python}
for variable in collection:
    do things with variable
~~~

We can call the **loop variable** anything we like,
but there must be a colon at the end of the line starting the loop,
and we must indent the body of the loop.

Here's another loop that repeatedly updates a variable:

~~~ {.python}
length = 0
for vowel in 'aeiou':
    length = length + 1
print 'There are', length, 'vowels'
~~~

It's worth tracing the execution of this little program step by step.
Since there are five characters in `'aeiou'`,
the statement on line 3 will be executed five times.
The first time around,
`length` is zero (the value assigned to it on line 1)
and `vowel` is `'a'`.
The statement adds 1 to the old value of `length`,
producing 1,
and updates `length` to refer to that new value.
The next time around,
`vowel` is `'e'` and `length` is 1,
so `length` is updated to be 2.
After three more updates,
`length` is 5;
since there is nothing left in `'aeiou'` for Python to process,
the loop finishes
and the `print` statement on line 4 tells us our final answer.

Note that a loop variable is just a variable that's being used to record progress in a loop.
It still exists after the loop is over,
and we can re-use variables previously defined as loop variables as well:

~~~ {.python}
letter = 'z'
for letter in 'abc':
    print letter
print 'after the loop, letter is', letter
~~~

Note also that finding the length of a string is such a common operation
that Python actually has a built-in function to do it called `len`:

~~~ {.python}
print len('aeiou')
~~~

`len` is much faster than any function we could write ourselves,
and much easier to read than a two-line loop;
it will also give us the length of many other things that we haven't met yet,
so we should always use it when we can.

## Lists

Just as a `for` loop is a way to do operations many times,
a list is a way to store many values.
Unlike NumPy arrays,
there are built into the language.
We create a list by putting values inside square brackets:

~~~ {.python}
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
print 'odds are:', odds
~~~

We select individual elements from lists by indexing them:

~~~ {.python}
print 'first and last:', odds[0], odds[-1]
~~~

and if we loop over a list,
the loop variable is assigned elements one at a time:

~~~ {.python}
for number in odds:
    print number
~~~

There is one important difference between lists and strings:
we can change the values in a list,
but we cannot change the characters in a string.
For example:

~~~ {.python}
names = ['Newton', 'Darwing', 'Turing'] # typo in Darwin's name
print 'names is originally:', names
names[1] = 'Darwin' # correct the name
print 'final value of names:', names
~~~

works, but:

~~~ {.python}
name = 'Bell'
name[0] = 'b'
~~~

does not.

There are many ways to change the contents of in lists besides assigning to elements:

~~~ {.python}
odds.append(11)
print 'odds after adding a value:', odds
~~~

FIXME: output

~~~ {.python}
del odds[0]
print 'odds after removing the first element:', odds
~~~

FIXME: output

~~~ {.python}
odds.reverse()
print 'odds after reversing:', odds
~~~

FIXME: output

## Processing Multiple Files

We now have almost everything we need to process all our data files.
The only thing that's missing is a library with a rather unpleasant name:

~~~ {.python}
import glob
~~~

The `glob` library contains a single function, also called `glob`,
that finds files whose names match a pattern.
We provide those patterns as strings:
the character `*` matches zero or more characters,
while `?` matches any one character.
We can use this to get the names of all the IPython Notebooks we have created so far:

~~~ {.python}
print glob.glob('*.ipynb')
~~~

~~~ {.output}
['01-numpy.ipynb', '02-func.ipynb', '03-loop.ipynb', '04-cond.ipynb', '05-defensive.ipynb', '06-cmdline.ipynb', 'spatial-intro.ipynb']
~~~

or to get the names of all our CSV data files:

~~~ {.python}
print glob.glob('*.csv')
~~~

~~~ {.output}
['inflammation-01.csv', 'inflammation-02.csv', 'inflammation-03.csv', 'inflammation-04.csv', 'inflammation-05.csv', 'inflammation-06.csv', 'inflammation-07.csv', 'inflammation-08.csv', 'inflammation-09.csv', 'inflammation-10.csv', 'inflammation-11.csv', 'inflammation-12.csv', 'small-01.csv', 'small-02.csv', 'small-03.csv']
~~~

As these examples show,
`glob.glob`'s result is a list of strings,
which means we can loop over it
to do something with each filename in turn.
In our case,
the "something" we want is our `analyze` function.
Let's test it by analyzing the first three files in the list:

~~~ {.python}
filenames = glob.glob('*.csv')
filenames = filenames[0:3]
for f in filenames:
    print f
    analyze(f)
~~~

~~~ {.output}
inflammation-01.csv
~~~

![Analysis of inflammation-01.csv](fig/03-loop_49_1.png)\ 

~~~ {.output}
inflammation-02.csv
~~~

![Analysis of inflammation-02.csv](fig/03-loop_49_3.png)\ 

~~~ {.output}
inflammation-03.csv
~~~

![Analysis of inflammation-02.csv](fig/03-loop_49_5.png)\ 

Sure enough,
the maxima of these data sets show exactly the same ramp as the first,
and their minima show the same staircase structure.
