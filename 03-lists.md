Just as a `for` loop is a way to do operations many times,
a list is a way to store many values.
Unlike NumPy arrays,
lists are built into the language (so we don't have to load a library
to use them).
We create a list by putting values inside square brackets:

~~~ {.python}
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
print('odds are:', odds)
~~~

~~~ {.output}
odds are: [1, 3, 5, 7]
~~~

We select individual elements from lists by indexing them:

~~~ {.python}
print('first and last:', odds[0], odds[-1])
~~~

~~~ {.output}
first and last: 1 7
~~~

and if we loop over a list,
the loop variable is assigned elements one at a time:

~~~ {.python}
for number in odds:
    print(number)
~~~

~~~ {.output}
1
3
5
7
~~~

There is one important difference between lists and strings:
we can change the values in a list,
but we cannot change the characters in a string.
For example:

~~~ {.python}
names = ['Newton', 'Darwing', 'Turing'] # typo in Darwin's name
print('names is originally:', names)
names[1] = 'Darwin' # correct the name
print('final value of names:', names)
~~~

~~~ {.output}
names is originally: ['Newton', 'Darwing', 'Turing']
final value of names: ['Newton', 'Darwin', 'Turing']
~~~

works, but:

~~~ {.python}
name = 'Bell'
name[0] = 'b'
~~~

~~~ {.error}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-8-220df48aeb2e> in <module>()
      1 name = 'Bell'
----> 2 name[0] = 'b'

TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
~~~

does not.

There are many ways to change the contents of lists besides assigning new values to
individual elements:

~~~ {.python}
odds.append(11)
print('odds after adding a value:', odds)
~~~
~~~ {.output}
[1, 3, 5, 7, 11]
~~~

~~~ {.python}
del odds[0]
print('odds after removing the first element:', odds)
~~~
~~~ {.output}
[3, 5, 7, 11]
~~~

~~~ {.python}
odds.reverse()
print('odds after reversing:', odds)
~~~
~~~ {.output}
[11, 7, 5, 3]
~~~
