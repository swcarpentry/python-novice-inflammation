::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Use a library function to get a list of filenames that match a wildcard pattern.
- Write a `for` loop to process multiple files.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How can I do the same operations on many different files?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

As a final piece to processing our inflammation data, we need a way to get a list of all the files
in our `data` directory whose names start with `inflammation-` and end with `.csv`.
The following library will help us to achieve this:

```python
import glob
```

The `glob` library contains a function, also called `glob`,
that finds files and directories whose names match a pattern.
We provide those patterns as strings:
the character `*` matches zero or more characters,
while `?` matches any one character.
We can use this to get the names of all the CSV files in the current directory:

```python
print(glob.glob('inflammation*.csv'))
```

```output
['inflammation-05.csv', 'inflammation-11.csv', 'inflammation-12.csv', 'inflammation-08.csv',
'inflammation-03.csv', 'inflammation-06.csv', 'inflammation-09.csv', 'inflammation-07.csv',
'inflammation-10.csv', 'inflammation-02.csv', 'inflammation-04.csv', 'inflammation-01.csv']
```

As these examples show,
`glob.glob`'s result is a list of file and directory paths in arbitrary order.
This means we can loop over it
to do something with each filename in turn.
In our case,
the "something" we want to do is generate a set of plots for each file in our inflammation dataset.

If we want to start by analyzing just the first three files in alphabetical order, we can use the
`sorted` built-in function to generate a new sorted list from the `glob.glob` output:

```python
import glob
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot

filenames = sorted(glob.glob('inflammation*.csv'))
filenames = filenames[0:3]
for filename in filenames:
    print(filename)

    data = numpy.loadtxt(fname=filename, delimiter=',')

    fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))

    axes1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 1)
    axes2 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 2)
    axes3 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 3)

    axes1.set_ylabel('average')
    axes1.plot(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))

    axes2.set_ylabel('max')
    axes2.plot(numpy.amax(data, axis=0))

    axes3.set_ylabel('min')
    axes3.plot(numpy.amin(data, axis=0))

    fig.tight_layout()
    matplotlib.pyplot.show()
```

```output
inflammation-01.csv
```

![](fig/03-loop_49_1.png){alt='Output from the first iteration of the for loop. Three line graphs showing the daily average, maximum and minimum inflammation over a 40-day period for all patients in the first dataset.'}

```output
inflammation-02.csv
```

![](fig/03-loop_49_3.png){alt='Output from the second iteration of the for loop. Three line graphs showing the daily average, maximum and minimum inflammation over a 40-day period for all patients in the second dataset.'}

```output
inflammation-03.csv
```

![](fig/03-loop_49_5.png){alt='Output from the third iteration of the for loop. Three line graphs showing the daily average, maximum and minimum inflammation over a 40-day period for all patients in the third dataset.'}

The plots generated for the second clinical trial file look very similar to the plots for
the first file: their average plots show similar "noisy" rises and falls; their maxima plots
show exactly the same linear rise and fall; and their minima plots show similar staircase
structures.

The third dataset shows much noisier average and maxima plots that are far less suspicious than
the first two datasets, however the minima plot shows that the third dataset minima is
consistently zero across every day of the trial. If we produce a heat map for the third data file
we see the following:

![](fig/inflammation-03-imshow.svg){alt='Heat map of the third inflammation dataset. Note that there are sporadic zero values throughout the entire dataset, and the last patient only has zero values over the 40 day study.'}

We can see that there are zero values sporadically distributed across all patients and days of the
clinical trial, suggesting that there were potential issues with data collection throughout the
trial. In addition, we can see that the last patient in the study didn't have any inflammation
flare-ups at all throughout the trial, suggesting that they may not even suffer from arthritis!

## Plotting Differences

Plot the difference between the average inflammations reported in the first and second datasets
(stored in `inflammation-01.csv` and `inflammation-02.csv`, correspondingly),
i.e., the difference between the leftmost plots of the first two figures.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```python
import glob
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot

filenames = sorted(glob.glob('inflammation*.csv'))

data0 = numpy.loadtxt(fname=filenames[0], delimiter=',')
data1 = numpy.loadtxt(fname=filenames[1], delimiter=',')

fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))

matplotlib.pyplot.ylabel('Difference in average')
matplotlib.pyplot.plot(numpy.mean(data0, axis=0) - numpy.mean(data1, axis=0))

fig.tight_layout()
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
```

## Generate Composite Statistics

Use each of the files once to generate a dataset containing values averaged over all patients by completing the code inside the loop given below:

```python
filenames = glob.glob('inflammation*.csv')
composite_data = numpy.zeros((60, 40))
for filename in filenames:
    # sum each new file's data into composite_data as it's read
    #
# and then divide the composite_data by number of samples
composite_data = composite_data / len(filenames)
```

Then use pyplot to generate average, max, and min for all patients.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```python
import glob
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot

filenames = glob.glob('inflammation*.csv')
composite_data = numpy.zeros((60, 40))

for filename in filenames:
    data = numpy.loadtxt(fname = filename, delimiter=',')
    composite_data = composite_data + data

composite_data = composite_data / len(filenames)

fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))

axes1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 1)
axes2 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 2)
axes3 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 3)

axes1.set_ylabel('average')
axes1.plot(numpy.mean(composite_data, axis=0))

axes2.set_ylabel('max')
axes2.plot(numpy.amax(composite_data, axis=0))

axes3.set_ylabel('min')
axes3.plot(numpy.amin(composite_data, axis=0))

fig.tight_layout()

matplotlib.pyplot.show()
```

After spending some time investigating the heat map and statistical plots, as well as
doing the above exercises to plot differences between datasets and to generate composite
patient statistics, we gain some insight into the twelve clinical trial datasets.

The datasets appear to fall into two categories:

- seemingly "ideal" datasets that agree excellently with Dr. Maverick's claims,
  but display suspicious maxima and minima (such as `inflammation-01.csv` and `inflammation-02.csv`)
- "noisy" datasets that somewhat agree with Dr. Maverick's claims, but show concerning
  data collection issues such as sporadic missing values and even an unsuitable candidate
  making it into the clinical trial.

In fact, it appears that all three of the "noisy" datasets (`inflammation-03.csv`,
`inflammation-08.csv`, and `inflammation-11.csv`) are identical down to the last value.
Armed with this information, we confront Dr. Maverick about the suspicious data and
duplicated files.

Dr. Maverick has admitted to fabricating the clinical data for their drug trial. They did this after discovering that the initial trial had several issues, including unreliable data recording and poor participant selection. In order to prove the efficacy of their drug, they created fake data. When asked for additional data, they attempted to generate more fake datasets, and also included the original poor-quality dataset several times in order to make the trials seem more realistic.

Congratulations! We've investigated the inflammation data and proven that the datasets have been
synthetically generated.

But it would be a shame to throw away the synthetic datasets that have taught us so much
already, so we'll forgive the imaginary Dr. Maverick and continue to use the data to learn
how to program.



:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Use `glob.glob(pattern)` to create a list of files whose names match a pattern.
- Use `*` in a pattern to match zero or more characters, and `?` to match any single character.
