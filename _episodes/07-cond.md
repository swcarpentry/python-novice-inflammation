In our last lesson, we discovered something suspicious was going on
in our inflammation data by drawing some plots.
How can we use Python to automatically recognize the different features we saw,
and take a different action for each? In this lesson, we'll learn how to write code that
runs only when certain conditions are true.

## Conditionals

We can ask Python to take different actions, depending on a condition, with an `if` statement:

~~~
num = 37
if num > 100:
    print('greater')
else:
    print('not greater')
print('done')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
not greater
done
~~~
{: .output}

The second line of this code uses the keyword `if` to tell Python that we want to make a choice.
If the test that follows the `if` statement is true,
the body of the `if`
(i.e., the set of lines indented underneath it) is executed, and "greater" is printed.
If the test is false,
the body of the `else` is executed instead, and "not greater" is printed.
Only one or the other is ever executed before continuing on with program execution to print "done":

![A flowchart diagram of the if-else construct that tests if variable num is greater than 100](../fig/python-flowchart-conditional.png)

Conditional statements don't have to include an `else`.
If there isn't one,
Python simply does nothing if the test is false:

~~~
num = 53
print('before conditional...')
if num > 100:
    print(num,' is greater than 100')
print('...after conditional')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
before conditional...
...after conditional
~~~
{: .output}

We can also chain several tests together using `elif`,
which is short for "else if".
The following Python code uses `elif` to print the sign of a number.

~~~
num = -3

if num > 0:
    print(num, 'is positive')
elif num == 0:
    print(num, 'is zero')
else:
    print(num, 'is negative')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
-3 is negative
~~~
{: .output}

Note that to test for equality we use a double equals sign `==`
rather than a single equals sign `=` which is used to assign values.

We can also combine tests using `and` and `or`.
`and` is only true if both parts are true:

~~~
if (1 > 0) and (-1 > 0):
    print('both parts are true')
else:
    print('at least one part is false')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
at least one part is false
~~~
{: .output}

while `or` is true if at least one part is true:

~~~
if (1 < 0) or (-1 < 0):
    print('at least one test is true')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
at least one test is true
~~~
{: .output}

> ## `True` and `False`
> `True` and `False` are special words in Python called `booleans`,
> which represent truth values. A statement such as `1 < 0` returns
> the value `False`, while `-1 < 0` returns the value `True`.
{: .callout}

## Checking our Data

Now that we've seen how conditionals work,
we can use them to check for the suspicious features we saw in our inflammation data.
We are about to use functions provided by the `numpy` module again.
Therefore, if you're working in a new Python session, make sure to load the
module with:

~~~
import numpy
~~~
{: .language-python}

From the first couple of plots, we saw that maximum daily inflammation exhibits
a strange behavior and raises one unit a day.
Wouldn't it be a good idea to detect such behavior and report it as suspicious?
Let's do that!
However, instead of checking every single day of the study, let's merely check
if maximum inflammation in the beginning (day 0) and in the middle (day 20) of
the study are equal to the corresponding day numbers.

~~~
max_inflammation_0 = numpy.max(data, axis=0)[0]
max_inflammation_20 = numpy.max(data, axis=0)[20]

if max_inflammation_0 == 0 and max_inflammation_20 == 20:
    print('Suspicious looking maxima!')
~~~
{: .language-python}

We also saw a different problem in the third dataset;
the minima per day were all zero (looks like a healthy person snuck into our study).
We can also check for this with an `elif` condition:

~~~
elif numpy.sum(numpy.min(data, axis=0)) == 0:
    print('Minima add up to zero!')
~~~
{: .language-python}

And if neither of these conditions are true, we can use `else` to give the all-clear:

~~~
else:
    print('Seems OK!')
~~~
{: .language-python}

Let's test that out:

~~~
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')

max_inflammation_0 = numpy.max(data, axis=0)[0]
max_inflammation_20 = numpy.max(data, axis=0)[20]

if max_inflammation_0 == 0 and max_inflammation_20 == 20:
    print('Suspicious looking maxima!')
elif numpy.sum(numpy.min(data, axis=0)) == 0:
    print('Minima add up to zero!')
else:
    print('Seems OK!')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Suspicious looking maxima!
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-03.csv', delimiter=',')

max_inflammation_0 = numpy.max(data, axis=0)[0]
max_inflammation_20 = numpy.max(data, axis=0)[20]

if max_inflammation_0 == 0 and max_inflammation_20 == 20:
    print('Suspicious looking maxima!')
elif numpy.sum(numpy.min(data, axis=0)) == 0:
    print('Minima add up to zero!')
else:
    print('Seems OK!')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Minima add up to zero!
~~~
{: .output}

In this way,
we have asked Python to do something different depending on the condition of our data.
Here we printed messages in all cases,
but we could also imagine not using the `else` catch-all
so that messages are only printed when something is wrong,
freeing us from having to manually examine every plot for features we've seen before.
