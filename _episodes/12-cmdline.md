The Jupyter Notebook and other interactive tools are great for prototyping code and exploring data,
but sooner or later we will want to use our program in a pipeline
or run it in a shell script to process thousands of data files.
In order to do that,
we need to make our programs work like other Unix command-line tools.
For example,
we may want a program that reads a dataset
and prints the average inflammation per patient.

{: .callout}

This program does exactly what we want - it prints the average inflammation per patient
for a given file.

~~~
$ python ../code/readings_04.py --mean inflammation-01.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
5.45
5.425
6.1
...
6.4
7.05
5.9
~~~
{: .output}

We might also want to look at the minimum of the first four lines

~~~
$ head -4 inflammation-01.csv | python ../code/readings_06.py --min
~~~
{: .language-bash}

or the maximum inflammations in several files one after another:

~~~
$ python ../code/readings_04.py --max inflammation-*.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Our scripts should do the following:

1. If no filename is given on the command line, read data from
[standard input]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#standard-input).
2. If one or more filenames are given, read data from them and report statistics for each file
separately.
3. Use the `--min`, `--mean`, or `--max` flag to determine what statistic to print.

To make this work,
we need to know how to handle command-line arguments in a program,
and understand how to handle standard input.
We'll tackle these questions in turn below.

## Command-Line Arguments

Using the text editor of your choice,
save the following in a text file called `sys_version.py`:

~~~
import sys
print('version is', sys.version)
~~~
{: .language-python}

The first line imports a library called `sys`,
which is short for "system".
It defines values such as `sys.version`,
which describes which version of Python we are running.
We can run this script from the command line like this:

~~~
$ python sys_version.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
version is 3.4.3+ (default, Jul 28 2015, 13:17:50)
[GCC 4.9.3]
~~~
{: .output}

Create another file called `argv_list.py` and save the following text to it.

~~~
import sys
print('sys.argv is', sys.argv)
~~~
{: .language-python}

The strange name `argv` stands for "argument values".
Whenever Python runs a program,
it takes all of the values given on the command line
and puts them in the list `sys.argv`
so that the program can determine what they were.
If we run this program with no arguments:

~~~
$ python argv_list.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
sys.argv is ['argv_list.py']
~~~
{: .output}

the only thing in the list is the full path to our script,
which is always `sys.argv[0]`.
If we run it with a few arguments, however:

~~~
$ python argv_list.py first second third
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
sys.argv is ['argv_list.py', 'first', 'second', 'third']
~~~
{: .output}

then Python adds each of those arguments to that magic list.

With this in hand, let's build a version of `readings.py` that always prints
the per-patient mean of a single data file.
The first step is to write a function that outlines our implementation,
and a placeholder for the function that does the actual work.
By convention this function is usually called `main`,
though we can call it whatever we want:

~~~
$ cat ../code/readings_01.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
import sys
import numpy


def main():
    script = sys.argv[0]
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    data = numpy.loadtxt(filename, delimiter=',')
    for row_mean in numpy.mean(data, axis=1):
        print(row_mean)
~~~
{: .language-python}

This function gets the name of the script from `sys.argv[0]`,
because that's where it's always put,
and the name of the file to process from `sys.argv[1]`.
Here's a simple test:

~~~
$ python ../code/readings_01.py inflammation-01.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

There is no output because we have defined a function,
but haven't actually called it.
Let's add a call to `main`:

~~~
$ cat ../code/readings_02.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
import sys
import numpy

def main():
    script = sys.argv[0]
    filename = sys.argv[1]
    data = numpy.loadtxt(filename, delimiter=',')
    for row_mean in numpy.mean(data, axis=1):
        print(row_mean)

if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()
~~~
{: .language-python}

and run that:

~~~
$ python ../code/readings_02.py inflammation-01.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

## Handling Multiple Files

The next step is to teach our program how to handle multiple files.
Since 60 lines of output per file is a lot to page through,
we'll start by using three smaller files,
each of which has three days of data for two patients:

~~~
$ ls small-*.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
small-01.csv small-02.csv small-03.csv
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ cat small-01.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
0,0,1
0,1,2
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ python ../code/readings_02.py small-01.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
0.333333333333
1.0
~~~
{: .output}

Using small data files as input also allows us to check our results more easily:
here,
for example,
we can see that our program is calculating the mean correctly for each line,
whereas we were really taking it on faith before.
This is yet another rule of programming:
*test the simple things first*.

We want our program to process each file separately,
so we need a loop that executes once for each filename.
If we specify the files on the command line,
the filenames will be in `sys.argv`,
but we need to be careful:
`sys.argv[0]` will always be the name of our script,
rather than the name of a file.
We also need to handle an unknown number of filenames,
since our program could be run for any number of files.

The solution to both problems is to loop over the contents of `sys.argv[1:]`.
The '1' tells Python to start the slice at location 1,
so the program's name isn't included;
since we've left off the upper bound,
the slice runs to the end of the list,
and includes all the filenames.
Here's our changed program
`readings_03.py`:

~~~
$ cat ../code/readings_03.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
import sys
import numpy

def main():
    script = sys.argv[0]
    for filename in sys.argv[1:]:
        data = numpy.loadtxt(filename, delimiter=',')
        for row_mean in numpy.mean(data, axis=1):
            print(row_mean)

if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()
~~~
{: .language-python}

and here it is in action:

~~~
$ python ../code/readings_03.py small-01.csv small-02.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
0.333333333333
1.0
13.6666666667
11.0
~~~
{: .output}

> ## The Right Way to Do It
>
> At this point,
> we have created three versions of our script called `readings_01.py`,
> `readings_02.py`, and `readings_03.py`.
> We wouldn't do this in real life:

> we would have one file called `readings.py` that we committed to version control
> every time we got an enhancement working.
> For teaching,
> though,
> we need all the successive versions side by side.
{: .callout}

## Handling Command-Line Flags

The next step is to teach our program to pay attention to the `--min`, `--mean`, and `--max` flags.
These always appear before the names of the files,
so we could do this:

~~~
$ cat ../code/readings_04.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
import sys
import numpy

def main():
    script = sys.argv[0]
    action = sys.argv[1]
    filenames = sys.argv[2:]

    for filename in filenames:
        data = numpy.loadtxt(filename, delimiter=',')

        if action == '--min':
            values = numpy.min(data, axis=1)
        elif action == '--mean':
            values = numpy.mean(data, axis=1)
        elif action == '--max':
            values = numpy.max(data, axis=1)

        for val in values:
            print(val)

if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()
~~~
{: .language-python}

This works:

~~~
$ python ../code/readings_04.py --max small-01.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
1.0
2.0
~~~
{: .output}

but there are several things wrong with it:

1.  `main` is too large to read comfortably.

2. If we do not specify at least two additional arguments on the
   command-line, one for the **flag** and one for the **filename**, but only
   one, the program will not throw an exception but will run. It assumes that the file
   list is empty, as `sys.argv[1]` will be considered the `action`, even if it
   is a filename. [Silent failures]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#silence-failure)  like this
   are always hard to debug.

3. The program should check if the submitted `action` is one of the three recognized flags.

This version pulls the processing of each file out of the loop into a function of its own.
It also checks that `action` is one of the allowed flags
before doing any processing,
so that the program fails fast:

~~~
$ cat ../code/readings_05.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
import sys
import numpy

def main():
    script = sys.argv[0]
    action = sys.argv[1]
    filenames = sys.argv[2:]
    assert action in ['--min', '--mean', '--max'], \
           'Action is not one of --min, --mean, or --max: ' + action
    for filename in filenames:
        process(filename, action)

def process(filename, action):
    data = numpy.loadtxt(filename, delimiter=',')

    if action == '--min':
        values = numpy.min(data, axis=1)
    elif action == '--mean':
        values = numpy.mean(data, axis=1)
    elif action == '--max':
        values = numpy.max(data, axis=1)

    for val in values:
        print(val)

if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()
~~~
{: .language-python}

This is four lines longer than its predecessor,
but broken into more digestible chunks of 8 and 12 lines.

## Handling Standard Input

The next thing our program has to do is read data from standard input if no filenames are given
so that we can put it in a pipeline,
redirect input to it,
and so on.
Let's experiment in another script called `count_stdin.py`:

~~~
$ cat ../code/count_stdin.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
import sys

count = 0
for line in sys.stdin:
    count += 1

print(count, 'lines in standard input')
~~~
{: .language-python}

This little program reads lines from a special "file" called `sys.stdin`,
which is automatically connected to the program's standard input.
We don't have to open it --- Python and the operating system
take care of that when the program starts up ---
but we can do almost anything with it that we could do to a regular file.
Let's try running it as if it were a regular command-line program:

~~~
$ python ../code/count_stdin.py < small-01.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
2 lines in standard input
~~~
{: .output}

A common mistake is to try to run something that reads from standard input like this:

~~~
$ python ../code/count_stdin.py small-01.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

i.e., to forget the `<` character that redirects the file to standard input.
In this case,
there's nothing in standard input,
so the program waits at the start of the loop for someone to type something on the keyboard.
Since there's no way for us to do this,
our program is stuck,
and we have to halt it using the `Interrupt` option from the `Kernel` menu in the Notebook.

We now need to rewrite the program so that it loads data from `sys.stdin`
if no filenames are provided.
Luckily,
`numpy.loadtxt` can handle either a filename or an open file as its first parameter,
so we don't actually need to change `process`.
Only `main` changes:

~~~
$ cat ../code/readings_06.py
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
import sys
import numpy

def main():
    script = sys.argv[0]
    action = sys.argv[1]
    filenames = sys.argv[2:]
    assert action in ['--min', '--mean', '--max'], \
           'Action is not one of --min, --mean, or --max: ' + action
    if len(filenames) == 0:
        process(sys.stdin, action)
    else:
        for filename in filenames:
            process(filename, action)

def process(filename, action):
    data = numpy.loadtxt(filename, delimiter=',')

    if action == '--min':
        values = numpy.min(data, axis=1)
    elif action == '--mean':
        values = numpy.mean(data, axis=1)
    elif action == '--max':
        values = numpy.max(data, axis=1)

    for val in values:
        print(val)

if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()
~~~
{: .language-python}

Let's try it out:

~~~
$ python ../code/readings_06.py --mean < small-01.csv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
0.333333333333
1.0
~~~
{: .output}

That's better.
In fact,
that's done:
the program now does everything we set out to do.

> *   If no filenames are given, it reports the number of lines in standard input.

>     followed by the total number of lines.
