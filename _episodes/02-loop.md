In the last lesson,
we wrote some code that plots some values of interest from our first inflammation dataset,
and reveals some suspicious features in it, such as from `inflammation-01.csv`

![Analysis of inflammation-01.csv](../fig/03-loop_2_0.png)

We have a dozen data sets right now, though, and more on the way.
We want to create plots for all of our data sets with a single statement.
To do that, we'll have to teach the computer how to repeat things.

An example task that we might want to repeat is printing each character in a
word on a line of its own.

~~~
word = 'lead'
~~~
{: .language-python}

We can access a character in a string using its index. For example, we can get the first
character of the word `'lead'`, by using `word[0]`. One way to print each character is to use
four `print` statements:

~~~
print(word[0])
print(word[1])
print(word[2])
print(word[3])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
l
e
a
d
~~~
{: .output}

This is a bad approach for two reasons:

1.  It doesn't scale:
    if we want to print the characters in a string that's hundreds of letters long,
    we'd be better off just typing them in.

1.  It's fragile:
    if we give it a longer string,
    it only prints part of the data,
    and if we give it a shorter one,
    it produces an error because we're asking for characters that don't exist.

~~~
word = 'tin'
print(word[0])
print(word[1])
print(word[2])
print(word[3])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
t
i
n
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-7974b6cdaf14> in <module>()
      3 print(word[1])
      4 print(word[2])
----> 5 print(word[3])

IndexError: string index out of range
~~~
{: .error}

Here's a better approach:

~~~
word = 'lead'
for char in word:
    print(char)

~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
l
e
a
d
~~~
{: .output}

This is shorter --- certainly shorter than something that prints every character in a hundred-letter string --- and
more robust as well:

~~~
word = 'oxygen'
for char in word:
    print(char)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
o
x
y
g
e
n
~~~
{: .output}

The improved version uses a [for loop]({{ page.root }}/reference/#for-loop)
to repeat an operation --- in this case, printing --- once for each thing in a sequence.
The general form of a loop is:

~~~
for variable in collection:
    do things with variable
~~~
{: .language-python}

Using the oxygen example above, the loop might look like this:

![loop_image](../fig/loops_image.png)

where each character (`char`) in the variable `word` is looped through and printed one character after another.
The numbers in the diagram denote which loop cycle the character was printed in (1 being the first loop, and 6 being the final loop).

We can call the [loop variable]({{ page.root }}/reference/#loop-variable) anything we like,
but to open the block we can't forget to put a colon (`:`) at the end of the line starting the loop,
then indent the code we want to run inside the loop. The colon identifies the beginning of a list of instructions, and the
instruction before it tells us how to handle the list, in this case meaning it is a set of instructions we will loop over.
Unlike many other languages, there is no
command to signify the end of the loop body (e.g. `end for`); the code block (i.e. indented section) 
after the `for` statement belongs to the loop -- you can also nest these!

> It is a good idea to choose variable names that are meaningful, otherwise it would be more difficult to understand what the loop is doing.
{: .callout}

Here's another loop that repeatedly updates a variable:

~~~
length = 0
for vowel in 'aeiou':
    length = length + 1
print('There are', length, 'vowels')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
There are 5 vowels
~~~
{: .output}

It's worth tracing the execution of this little program step by step.
Since there are five characters in `'aeiou'`,
the statement on line 3 will be executed five times.
The first time around,
`length` is zero (the value assigned to it on line 1)
and `vowel` is `'a'`.
The statement adds 1 to the old value of `length`,
producing 1,
and updates `length` to refer to that new value.
The next time around,
`vowel` is `'e'` and `length` is 1,
so `length` is updated to be 2.
After three more updates,
`length` is 5;
since there is nothing left in `'aeiou'` for Python to process,
the loop finishes
and the `print` statement on line 4 tells us our final answer.

Note that a loop variable is just a variable that's being used to record progress in a loop.
It still exists after the loop is over,
and we can re-use variables previously defined as loop variables as well:

~~~
letter = 'z'
for letter in 'abc':
    print(letter)
print('after the loop, letter is', letter)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
a
b
c
after the loop, letter is c
~~~
{: .output}

Note also that finding the length of a string is such a common operation
that Python actually has a built-in function to do it called `len`:

~~~
print(len('aeiou'))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
5
~~~
{: .output}

`len` is much faster than any function we could write ourselves,
and much easier to read than a two-line loop;
it will also give us the length of many other things that we haven't met yet,
so we should always use it when we can.
