title: Storing Multiple Values in Lists
teaching: 30
exercises: 15
questions:
- "How can I store many values together?"
objectives:
- "Explain what a list is."
- "Create and index lists of simple values."
- "Change the values of individual elements"
- "Append values to an existing list"
- "Reorder and slice list elements"
- "Create and manipulate nested lists"
keypoints:
- "`[value1, value2, value3, ...]` creates a list."
- "Lists can contain any Python object, including lists (i.e., list of lists)."
- "Lists are indexed and sliced with square brackets (e.g., list[0] and
list[2:9]), in the same way as strings and arrays."
- "Lists are mutable (i.e., their values can be changed in place)."
- "Strings are immutable (i.e., the characters in them cannot be changed)."

Similar to a string that can contain many characters, a list is a container that can store many values.
Unlike NumPy arrays,
lists are built into the language (so we don't have to load a library
to use them).
We create a list by putting values inside square brackets and separating the values with commas:

~~~
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
print('odds are:', odds)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
odds are: [1, 3, 5, 7]
~~~
{: .output}

We can access elements of a list using indices -- numbered positions of elements in the list.
These positions are numbered starting at 0, so the first element has an index of 0.

~~~
print('first element:', odds[0])
print('last element:', odds[3])
print('"-1" element:', odds[-1])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
first element: 1
last element: 7
"-1" element: 7
~~~
{: .output}

Yes, we can use negative numbers as indices in Python. When we do so, the index `-1` gives us the
last element in the list, `-2` the second to last, and so on.
Because of this, `odds[3]` and `odds[-1]` point to the same element here.

If we loop over a list, the loop variable is assigned to its elements one at a time:

~~~
for number in odds:
    print(number)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
1
3
5
7
~~~
{: .output}

There is one important difference between lists and strings:
we can change the values in a list,
but we cannot change individual characters in a string.
For example:

~~~
names = ['Curie', 'Darwing', 'Turing']  # typo in Darwin's name
print('names is originally:', names)
names[1] = 'Darwin'  # correct the name
print('final value of names:', names)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
names is originally: ['Curie', 'Darwing', 'Turing']
final value of names: ['Curie', 'Darwin', 'Turing']
~~~
{: .output}

works, but:

~~~
name = 'Darwin'
name[0] = 'd'
~~~
{: .language-python}

There are many ways to change the contents of lists besides assigning new values to
individual elements:

~~~
odds.append(11)
print('odds after adding a value:', odds)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
odds after adding a value: [1, 3, 5, 7, 11]
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
removed_element = odds.pop(0)
print('odds after removing the first element:', odds)
print('removed_element:', removed_element)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
odds after removing the first element: [3, 5, 7, 11]
removed_element: 1
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
odds.reverse()
print('odds after reversing:', odds)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
odds after reversing: [11, 7, 5, 3]
~~~
{: .output}

While modifying in place, it is useful to remember that Python treats lists in a slightly
counter-intuitive way.

As we saw earlier, when we modified the `salsa` list item in-place, if we make a list, (attempt to) copy it and then modify this list, we can cause all sorts of trouble. This also applies to modifying the list using the above functions:

~~~
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
primes = odds
primes.append(2)
print('primes:', primes)
print('odds:', odds)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
primes: [1, 3, 5, 7, 2]
odds: [1, 3, 5, 7, 2]
~~~
{: .output}

This is because Python stores a list in memory, and then can use multiple names to refer to the
same list. If all we want to do is copy a (simple) list, we can again use the `list` function, so we do
not modify a list we did not mean to:

~~~
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
primes = list(odds)
primes.append(2)
print('primes:', primes)
print('odds:', odds)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
primes: [1, 3, 5, 7, 2]
odds: [1, 3, 5, 7]
~~~

Subsets of lists and strings can be accessed by specifying ranges of values in brackets,
similar to how we accessed ranges of positions in a NumPy array.
This is commonly referred to as "slicing" the list/string.

~~~
binomial_name = 'Drosophila melanogaster'
group = binomial_name[0:10]
print('group:', group)

species = binomial_name[11:23]
print('species:', species)

chromosomes = ['X', 'Y', '2', '3', '4']
autosomes = chromosomes[2:5]
print('autosomes:', autosomes)

last = chromosomes[-1]
print('last:', last)
~~~
{: .language-python}

group: Drosophila
species: melanogaster
autosomes: ['2', '3', '4']
last: 4

If you want to take a slice from the beginning of a sequence, you can omit the first index in the
range:

~~~
date = 'Monday 4 January 2016'
day = date[0:6]
print('Using 0 to begin range:', day)
day = date[:6]
print('Omitting beginning index:', day)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Using 0 to begin range: Monday
Omitting beginning index: Monday
~~~
{: .output}

And similarly, you can omit the ending index in the range to take a slice to the very end of the
sequence:

~~~
months = ['jan', 'feb', 'mar', 'apr', 'may', 'jun', 'jul', 'aug', 'sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec']
sond = months[8:12]
print('With known last position:', sond)
sond = months[8:len(months)]
print('Using len() to get last entry:', sond)
sond = months[8:]
print('Omitting ending index:', sond)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
With known last position: ['sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec']
Using len() to get last entry: ['sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec']
Omitting ending index: ['sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec']
