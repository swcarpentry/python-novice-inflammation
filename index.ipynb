You can edit them dynamically (try double clicking on this cell to edit the text) then see the output by running them with **Ctrl+ENTER** or by clicking the run icon above. Try the cell below - enter the code `1 + 2` then press `CTRL+ENTER` and it will run the code with Python. Feel free during this lesson to edit, modify and run the cells again and again. Any output (text or images) will appear below the cell."
