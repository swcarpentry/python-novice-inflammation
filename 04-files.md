We now have almost everything we need to process all our data files.
The only thing that's missing is a library with a rather unpleasant name:

~~~ {.python}
import glob
~~~

The `glob` library contains a single function, also called `glob`,
that finds files whose names match a pattern.
We provide those patterns as strings:
the character `*` matches zero or more characters,
while `?` matches any one character.
We can use this to get the names of all the HTML files in the current directory:

~~~ {.python}
print(glob.glob('*.html'))
~~~

~~~ {.output}
['01-numpy.html', '02-loop.html', '03-lists.html', '04-files.html', '05-cond.html', '06-func.html', '07-errors.html', '08-defensive.html', '09-debugging.html', '10-cmdline.html', 'index.html', 'LICENSE.html', 'instructors.html', 'README.html', 'discussion.html', 'reference.html']
~~~

As these examples show,
`glob.glob`'s result is a list of strings,
which means we can loop over it
to do something with each filename in turn.
In our case,
the "something" we want to do is generate a set of plots for each file in our inflammation dataset.
Let's test it by analyzing the first three files in the list:

~~~ {.python}
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot

filenames = glob.glob('inflammation*.csv')
filenames = filenames[0:3]
for f in filenames:
    print(f)

    data = numpy.loadtxt(fname=f, delimiter=',')

    fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))

    axes1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 1)
    axes2 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 2)
    axes3 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 3)

    axes1.set_ylabel('average')
    axes1.plot(data.mean(axis=0))

    axes2.set_ylabel('max')
    axes2.plot(data.max(axis=0))

    axes3.set_ylabel('min')
    axes3.plot(data.min(axis=0))

    fig.tight_layout()
    matplotlib.pyplot.show(fig)
~~~

~~~ {.output}
inflammation-01.csv
~~~

![Analysis of inflammation-01.csv](fig/03-loop_49_1.png)\


~~~ {.output}
inflammation-02.csv
~~~

![Analysis of inflammation-02.csv](fig/03-loop_49_3.png)\


~~~ {.output}
inflammation-03.csv
~~~

Sure enough,
the maxima of the first two data sets show exactly the same ramp as the first,
and their minima show the same staircase structure;
a different situation has been revealed in the third dataset,
where the maxima are a bit less regular, but the minima are consistently zero.
